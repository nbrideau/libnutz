# libnutz

libnutz is a client server networking library in C++ along with any other helper code I would use to write a server. This is part of my portfolio and is essentially proof that I can write code.

LN should make it easy to write servers and clients. Servers will use pthreads and run a thread per connection.

## Installation

Compile and install.

```bash
make -f Makefile.git
./configure 
make 
make install
```

## Usage

TODO. I expect to write some kind of app that uses this library. I'll link to it here later.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome though unexpected.
